### Installation Steps

3. If prompted, allow installation from unknown sources
4. Open the app after installation

### First Launch

On first launch, the app will download the AI models (~500MB total). This requires an internet connection but is a one-time download. After that, everything runs completely offline.

## iOS

iOS builds require additional Apple Developer setup. For hackathon judging, please use an Android device or the demo mode on web.
